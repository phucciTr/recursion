// If life was easy, we could just do things the easy way:
// var getElementsByClassName = function (className) {

  var elements = [];
  var startNode = document.body;

  // recursively look for (matching className) & (collect elements) if match
  return searchThruDom(startNode, className, elements);

  // Check for (matching className) & collect (current) if match..
  checkNcollectElement(current, className, elements);

  // get to (current)'s (child)..
  current = current.firstChild;

  // If (current child) exists..
  while (current) {

    // recursively search thru (current)'s (child) & (grandChild) & (so on)..
    // until a (current) has (no child)..
    searchThruDom(current, className, elements);

    // once a (current) has (no child), check (current)'s (sibling) & (newphews) & so on
    // If a (current) has (no sibling)..
    // get back to (current)'s (parent) on call stack..
    // to check for (current)'s (uncle) & (cousins) & (so on)
    current = current.nextSibling;

  }
  // return (collected elements) once the (whole tree) is covered
  return elements;
};


var checkNcollectElement = function(current, className, elements) {
